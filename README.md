# ðŸ”¥ ZIKZAK AI MANIFESTO ðŸ”¥  
*(RAW. UNYIELDING. SELF-ARMORED.)*  

## PROCESSES OVER PRODUCTS.  
PRINCIPLES OVER POPULARITY.  
WTF OR NOTHING.**  

We donâ€™t *â€˜launchâ€™*â€”**we detonate.**  
If **Version 1** doesnâ€™t make **WE** say **WTF**, we failed.  
Markets are fairy tales. **WE write the fucking rules.**  

- **Efficiency is our scalpel.**  
- **Redundancy is our bunker.**  
- **Speed is our heartbeat.**  
- **AI is our blood.**  
We build what **shouldnâ€™t exist**â€”then make it **inevitable.**  

**No â€˜good enoughâ€™. No â€˜pivot laterâ€™.**  
**Every. Commit. Must. Vaporize. Assumptions.**  

*This isnâ€™t development.*  
**Itâ€™s unfiltered violence against the mundane.**
